      title: Active Research Projects
      text: |
        I am deeply committed to exploring the rich complexities of human neurodevelopment and mental health. This section highlights a variety of research projects where I actively engage, either leading or significantly contributing, in efforts to expand our understanding across multiple intersecting disciplinesâ€”Affective Neuroscience, Computational Psychiatry, Psychiatric Epidemiology, Developmental Psychology, and Neuropsychopharmacology.
        
        My approach to scientific praxis as a scholar emphasizes continual learning and critical reflection, ensuring that my contributions remain grounded in empathy and rigorous inquiry. Through this work, I strive to bridge the gap between theoretical research and practical applications, aiming to positively influence mental health interventions and policies.
