This study extends analyses conducted by [Verdi et al. (2023)](https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/WNL.0000000000207298), who utilized normative modeling techniques to delineate neuroanatomical heterogeneity in Alzheimer's disease. We employ a similar methodological framework to supplement these insights by integrating both structural MRI data and neuropsychiatric symptom profiles. This integration allowed us to explore more deeply the neuroanatomical and neuropsychiatric underpinnings of Alzheimer's disease across different phenotypes within our ADNI subset.
