This project aims to examine longitudinal changes in risk- and reward-related behaviors and decision-making among a general community sample over the first year following the initial COVID-19 lock-down in the United States, which began in March 2020. The focus is to understand how these behaviors evolved during the pandemic and to identify the factors influencing these trajectories.
