The study utilizes data from the National Survey of Childrenâ€™s Health (NSCH), focusing on children aged 6-17 with reported neurodevelopmental issues (N = 44,776, M<sub>Age</sub> = 12.2). This cross-sectional analysis examines ACE exposure and its impact on three primary mental health outcomes: anxiety, depression, and behavioral issues. The moderating role of child flourishing behaviors is assessed using interaction terms in logistic regression models.
