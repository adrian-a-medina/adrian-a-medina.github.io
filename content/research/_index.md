        I plan to explore the clinical, epigenetic, and neurodevelopmental impacts of adverse and traumatic experiences, focusing on how dimensions of threat, deprivation, and unpredictability influence individuals from perinatal stages through young adulthood. My goal is to investigate the intricate relationships between traumatic/adverse experiences and long-term health outcomes, aiming to unravel the complex interplay of biological, psychological, and social factors that shape mental and physical health. As I prepare to enter a PhD program, my research will seek to illuminate these crucial intersections, contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of how early life stressors impact lifelong health and well-being.

      title: 'Computational Conduits: Pioneering Precision Psychiatry Through Advanced Modeling'
      text: | 
        <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adrian-a-medina/adrian-a-medina.github.io/main/assets/media/CP-Model.svg" 
        alt="Computational Diagram"
        style="width: 100%; max-width: 400px; margin: 10px auto; display: block;">

        My research seeks to pioneer the use of normative and computational modeling to revolutionize the field of precision psychiatry. By integrating advanced neuroimaging techniques with behavioral and epigenetic data, I aim to develop refined models that predict individual mental health outcomes with unprecedented accuracy. This approach will not only improve our understanding of psychiatric disorders but also tailor interventions to the unique biological profile of each patient. Through this innovative research, I plan to contribute to the creation of more personalized and effective psychiatric treatments, thereby transforming how mental health care is approached and administered.

      title: 'Ecosystems of Emotion: Tracing Social and Ecological Influences on Development'
      text: | 
        <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adrian-a-medina/adrian-a-medina.github.io/main/assets/media/Eco-Model.svg" 
        alt="Ecological Diagram"
        style="width: 100%; max-width: 400px; margin: 10px auto; display: block;">

        I plan to explore the dynamic interactions between ecological systems and social determinants of health, focusing on how they influence emotional processing mechanisms from perinatal stages through young adulthood. My research will delve into understanding the complex effects of environmental and social factors on emotional health, aiming to identify intervention strategies that effectively mitigate adverse effects and enhance developmental trajectories. This area of study seeks to provide deep insights into how varied ecological and social contexts contribute to emotional wellbeing, paving the way for innovative, targeted approaches that support sustained emotional growth and resilience.

      title: 'Cultivating Resilience: Multilevel Approaches for Flourishing in Oppressed Communities'
      text: | 
        <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adrian-a-medina/adrian-a-medina.github.io/main/assets/media/Res-Model.svg" 
        alt="Resilience Diagram"
        style="width: 100%; max-width: 400px; margin: 10px auto; display: block;">

        I intend to focus on contextualized interventions that foster resilience, thriving, and flourishing among oppressed communities, utilizing strategies that engage at the structural, community, and individual levels. My research will examine the effectiveness of these comprehensive interventions, particularly how they meet the unique challenges faced by these communities to promote sustainable growth and well-being. I am especially interested in exploring the potential of psychoeducation, psychotherapy, & psychedelic therapeutics as transformative tools for personal development and mental health at the individual level. Through my doctoral studies, I aspire to contribute significantly to the development and refinement of interventions that not only address but also transcend the adversities faced by oppressed populations.
